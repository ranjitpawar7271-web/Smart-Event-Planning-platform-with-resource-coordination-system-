"""
Module 9 — Workflow, Notifications & Calendar.

Three concerns live in one app because they're small and tightly related:
approvals gate a status change, notifications tell someone about it, and
the calendar is just a read-only view over dates that already exist on
Event/VenueBooking/ShiftAssignment. None of them need their own app.

ApprovalStep is deliberately generic (via ContentType) rather than a
straight FK to Event, matching the spec's "generic-ish model that can
attach to an Event (and later other approvable things)". Today only
Event uses it (the Draft -> Published gate); a future module can reuse
the same model for, say, vendor contract sign-off, without a migration
on this app.
