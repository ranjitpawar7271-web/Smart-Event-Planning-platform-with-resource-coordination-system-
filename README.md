# EventSphere — Event Management System

A full-stack, production-quality event management platform built with **Django 5**,
**Bootstrap 5**, **Bootstrap Icons**, and **SQLite**. EventSphere lets organizers create
and manage events, and lets attendees discover, search, and register for them — all
through a modern, glassmorphism-styled SaaS-style interface.

No custom JavaScript is used anywhere in the project — only Bootstrap's own bundled JS
(`bootstrap.bundle.min.js`), which is required for the responsive navbar, dropdowns, and
dismissible alerts to function.

## Getting Started

### 1. Create a virtual environment & install dependencies
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Apply migrations
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```
(A `db.sqlite3` with sample categories, sample events, and a superuser is already
included — you can skip straight to step 4 if you'd like to explore immediately.)

### 3. Create a superuser (only needed if you reset the database)
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### 4. Run the development server
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
Visit **http://127.0.0.1:8000/**

### Demo login (included in the shipped database)
```
Username: admin
Password: Admin@12345
```
This account is a superuser and organizer, so it can create events, manage categories,
and access Django admin at `/admin/`.

## Notes for Presentation / Evaluation

- Each Django app (`users`, `events`, `categories`, `dashboard`) is self-contained with
  its own `models.py`, `forms.py`, `views.py`, `urls.py`, and `admin.py` — easy to walk
  through module by module.
- All forms use Django `ModelForm`s with server-side validation and Bootstrap floating
  labels / styled inputs.
- Access control: only an event's organizer (or staff) can edit/delete it; only staff
  can manage categories.
- `EMAIL_BACKEND` is set to the console backend for development, so password-reset
  emails print to the terminal instead of being sent — swap in a real SMTP backend for
  production.
